\section*{Abstract:}
The abstract must fit on the first page and should not include figures, tables,
or citations. The abstract has the section heading \textbf{Abstract:}, bold
11~pt Times New Roman, and the primary text should be written in Times New
Roman, 10~pt. All these fonts are already set and should not be edited.

\section*{Introduction}
Authors are requested to upload a paper of 6 to 12 pages (including references
and figures) to the Orvium web site by the stated date in the call for papers.
For LaTeX documents, upload a single ZIP file that includes the minimum set of
source files needed to build a PDF. The ZIP file should be named using the
following pattern \verb|Surname1Surname2Surname3_abstract.zip|. The primary
LaTeX file should be named \verb|paper.tex| and should reside in the root of
the ZIP file directory tree. Avoid using LaTeX packages other than those listed
in the \verb|bmd2023p.cls| file for compatibility with Orvium.

The paper must be written in English. It must contain the names, affiliations,
and e-mail addresses of the authors. Do not edit the headers or footers or the
list of publisher variables. The paper size is European A4 (21 x 29.7 cm). The
left and right margins are 1.27~cm, the top margin (not including the header)
is 2.5~cm, and the bottom margin is 1.9~cm. The title should be in Times New
Roman 18pt, and may extend over more than one line. The author's name or
authors' names should be in Times New Roman 10pt and the affiliation should be
in 8pt.

\section*{Equations, Figures, and Tables}

Equations should be numbered continuously according to the format shown in
Equation~(\ref{eq:equ1}):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:equ1}
  e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0,
\end{equation}
where the unknown symbols are explained after the equation.

Figures, graphs, and tables must be included using the same style as in
Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} and Table~\ref{tab:tab1}. Both figures and tables should
be centered on the page. Use of at least 300 dpi resolution for pictures and
600 dpi for line art is required, 1 px wide lines in figures should be avoided
as they may become invisible in print.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=55mm]{figure1}
    \caption{An example of a figure caption. Use 10~pt Times New Roman. Use the
      same style for the tables.}
    \label{fig:fig1}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Example of a table with a short caption.} \label{tab:tab1}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|ccc|}
      \hline
      &  $x$  &  $y$  &  $z$ \\
      \hline
      $x'$  &  $\alpha_1$ & $\beta_1$ & $\gamma_1$ \\
      $y'$  &  $\alpha_2$ & $\beta_2$ & $\gamma_2$ \\
      $z'$  &  $\alpha_3$ & $\beta_3$ & $\gamma_3$ \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\section*{Bibliography}

Bibliographical citations should be written in alphabetical order in the
\textbf{References} section at the end of the document and use the APA citation
system and the APA format. See the \textbf{References} section below, where
\citep{Pac02} exemplifies the case of a textbook, \citep{Ber07} is an article
in a conference proceedings, and \citep{Sha71} is an article in a journal. Make
use of the \verb|natbib| package with \verb|\citep{}| or \verb|\citet{}| for
citations. If using a \verb|.bib| file, use the \verb|apalike| bibliography
style to get APA formatting.

\section*{Conclusion}

We very much look forward to welcoming you in Delft! Best wishes and the
warmest regards from the Organizing Committee of Bicycle and Motorcycle
Dynamics 2023.
